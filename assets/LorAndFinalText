During a huge civil war caused by the extreme use of natural resources in a far away planet, the solution to the leak of energy was to get the almighty crystals in the other side of the galaxy. But for that, two robots were created, Case and Tars. So, the two poor little droids were sent through the Gargantua BlackHole to get those damned crystals. In the other side of the Gargantua the brave droids must face their fear of the dark, solve the mazes, manage their use of battery, get the crystals and come back home for glory and salvation.












Congrats, you got the crystals, come back home and Stay.
